We can install syntax highlighting by liujim and vetur extension.

Exploring the folder structure.
In src folder we have a main.js file. This is the entry point of the application
It is pretty much like we we have seen the previous lessons with a slight difference

Next we check the App.vue file. In this file we can do what we have been doing in the early videos. e.g.
to create a data and properties inside it we do it slightly different see sample below

data() {
    return {
        hello: "Hello from the other side"
    }
}

i.e. this now works like a function.
In this file we also have a component which we will look into later called HelloWorld being imported
from components. Looking at this file we see that it comprises of some style and html with js.
We also export it for use by other files by adding the export to it.\

Adding scoped to our style means we want to say add only this style to this template alone.

Creating and Using components. A component is a piece of code that you can reuse. It can be in form of a page or layout or container
etc. 

Creating our first component we go to the components folder and create Header.vue
import it iun app.vue and reference it in the component as well as use a directive which we can do in two ways
<header></header> or <Header />

Props: This refers to how one components talks to another component and how you can pass along data from one to the other.

Checking our App.vue file we can see msg in the HelloWorld component with welcome to your vue js app.
We can replicate this by creating a props in the Header components with title of type string then add {{title}}
to the h1 tag. We can also declare the title as a property in our data(). To use it in the html we have to use 
v-bind:title="title" this can also be rewritten like this :title="title"

Looping in views (iterations)
we use the v-for for looping through a collection. To get the index we wrap the item in bracket and then
pass in a second parameter index

MADE A PART two

Computed Properties - This refers to the modification of data in our application before it is displayed.

We start developing the application here. First of I will remove the helloworld component as well as 

the first api url we called to retuyrn everything in the vue cosole is

"https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key=6fe4e2cd9edc107dd7d61509d3d05de3"

"https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?sort_by=popularity.desc&api_key=6fe4e2cd9edc107dd7d61509d3d05de3"
